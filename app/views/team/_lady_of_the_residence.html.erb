				<p> Katja started breeding horses over 20 years ago in Finland. 2004 she moved to England and decided to have her own place. Dressage has always been closest to Katjas heart, but there are more and more show jumping horses coming every year...

				<p> You cant run a horse stable without a good team. All Riders, Trainers, Grooms, Vets, Farriers, Physios and Friends are very much needed to keep everything running so well. Thank You.
